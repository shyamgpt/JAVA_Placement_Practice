 * Here’s a simple and clear explanation of Agile and Scrum — especially useful for QA & Automation roles:

✅ What is Agile?

-Agile is a software development methodology that focuses on:

-Delivering work in small parts (increments)

-Continuous improvement

-Quick feedback

F-lexibility to handle changing requirements

-Close collaboration with business, developers, testers

Think of Agile like this:

👉 Instead of building the whole product at once, teams deliver small features regularly and improve fast.

✅ What is Scrum?

Scrum is a framework inside Agile.
It gives a step-by-step structured way to implement Agile.

Scrum defines:

🔹 1. Scrum Roles

Product Owner (PO) – Decides what to build (priorities).

Scrum Master (SM) – Ensures team follows Scrum, removes blockers.

Development Team – Dev + QA + Automation + Designer etc.

🔹 2. Scrum Ceremonies

Sprint Planning – Decide what to build in the next 1–4 week sprint.

Daily Stand-up – 15-minute daily meeting (what did you do, blockers).

Sprint Review – Demo the completed work.

Sprint Retrospective – Discuss what went well & what to improve.

🔹 3. Scrum Artifacts

Product Backlog – List of all features & requirements.

Sprint Backlog – Items selected for the current sprint.

Increment – Working software delivered at the end of sprint.

📌 Agile vs Scrum (Easy Comparison)
Agile	Scrum
A methodology	A framework of Agile
Flexible principles	Step-by-step process
No fixed roles	Specific roles (PO, SM, Dev Team)
Can be used in many ways	Uses sprints, ceremonies & artifacts
🎯 One-line Summary

Agile = philosophy
Scrum = how you follow that philosophy

	 * Agile model/Agile Methodolgy/Agile process-->
	 * ============================================
	 * Agile is a principal
	 * Definiton-->
	 * It is an Iterative and Incremental Approach.
	 * Agile is an Iterative and Incremental Process.
	 * 
	 * 
	 * Iterative meaning - > Repeating the same things again and again.
	 * Requirememt collection --> Design --> Coding--> testing
	 * Incremantal --> Bulding/Adding new feature above the other.
	 * 
	 * 
	 * Agile principles-->
	 * -----------------
	 * 1) Customer no need to wait for long time.
	 * 2) We developed, test and release the piece of software to the customer
	 * with few number of features.
	 * 3)We can accept/accomodate requirement changes
	 * 
	 * There will be goood communication between Customer, BA, Developer & Testers
	 * In Agile, delivery is faster as we have 2-3 weeks of Sprints.
	 * 
	 * 
	 * Advantages -->
	 * -------------
	 * 
	 * 1) Requirement chnages are allowed in any stage of Development.
	 * 2) Release will be very fast
	 * 3) Customer no need to wait for long time.
	 * 4) Good communication between team.
	 * 5) It is very easy model to adopt.
	 * 
	 * Disadvantages -->
	 * ---------------
	 * 
	 * Less focus on design and documentation since we deliver the software very fast.
	 * 
	 * 
	 * Agile is a process Model./Define the Principle/ How the process should be/and to
	 * follow this principle/process, scrum is a framework which will help us.
	 * Agile has some defined process.
	 * Scrum help us to follow the priciple of agile.
	 * ------
	 * Agile is defined process, like we have follow this set rules ans scrum says 
	 * how to follow these principles and how to implement those principle/process.
	 *  
	 * SCRUM-->
	 * ======
	 * Scrum is a framework through which we build software product by following 
	 * agile principles.
	 * 
	 * Scrum include group of people called as scrum team, Normally contains 5-9 members.
	 * 
	 * In agile everybody will work together as a single team.
	 * 
	 * 1) Product owner
	 * 2) Scrume Master
	 * 3) Dev team
	 * 4) QA Team
	 * 
	 * 
	 * 1) Product Onwer-->
	 * A) Prioritize the Product Backlog (Most Important)-->
	 * PO decides what to build first based on:
	 * Business value
	 * Customer needs
	 * Deadlines
	 * ROI
	 * This is the core PO responsibility.
	 * 
	 * B)Define Clear Requirements (User Stories + Acceptance Criteria)-->
	 * PO ensures:
	 * 
	 * 
	 * 
	 * 
	 * 
	 * 
	 * 
	 * 
	 * 
	 * 
	 *
