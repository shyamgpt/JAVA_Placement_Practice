	 * What is Maven?

	 * Maven Commands
	 * -Run Maven from Eclipse
	 * -Run Maven from Command Line
	 * 
	 * 1- What is Maven?
	 * Maven is a build automation tool, it generates the Builds
	 * It's a central respository where all the jar files are
	 * present in the form of dependencies
	 * Eg like-> Selenium, testNg, Apache POI etc
	 * In dependencies we have 3 attribute-
	 * i). groupId
	 * ii). artifactId
	 * iii). versions
	 * 
	 * 2- Maven Setup?
	 * Visit- mkyong.com
	 * 
	 * 3- Maven Life Cycle?
	 * Maven is a build automation tool.
	 * It has 3 main life cycle-->
	 * a. Maven compile
	 * b. Maven Test
	 * c. Maven Resource-Jar/ or Generate Jar files.
	 * 
	 * a. Maven Compile--it will compile the Java classes/Code
	 * and this compile will happen by using- compiler plugin
	 * 
	 * b. Maven test-- it can be functional testcases, Integration test cases, 
	 * unit testcases etc,
	 * 
	 * Maven Test is done by Maven Surefire Plugin
	 * 
	 * c. Generating/Creating Jar files--
	 * It can create 3 types of resource
	 * JARs/WARs/EARs files
	 * and this is done by Maven Resources Plugin
	 * 
	 * 4- Maven Dependencies -->
	 * Jar files which are available in Maven central repository in the form of
	 * dependencies are known as maven dependencies.
	 * 
	 * 
	 * 
	 * 
	 * 
	 * 
	 * Build is sucssfull means--all the artifacts/ jars are downloaded properly
	 * and build is cleaned and the latest build is available now.
	 * 
	 * 
	 * 
	 * 
	 * 
	 * -> to run the code in eclipse we will click on "maven test" the it will
	 * run and will the output, but it will not gererates the TestNg report as we 
	 * run from Maven.
	 * 
	 * 
	 * -->Running Maven from Command line->
	 * 
	 * a) mvn clean install
	 * - Firstly it will execute all the 4 maven life cycle
	 * -it will create the build in form of jar files, along with the 
	 * testcase execution
	 * - when you run this cmd then it will generate the build.
	 * 
	 * b) mvn test -->
	 * It will execute only your test case
	 * and it will not generate the build.
	 * 
	 * c) mvn package -DskipTests
	 * What if i dont want to execute the test cases and just want to generate 
	 * the build and want to ignore the test case execution.
	 *
